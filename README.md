# Solar System Simulation Project

## Description
The project demonstrates how planets move around the sun, using authentic astronomical values.
Gravity was applied to each planet to ensure realistic elliptical orbits.

### RUN Information
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. Clone the repository
> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SolarSystemSimulation.git
2. Create a Virtual Environment with the following requirements
> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run **_main.py_**

Note:
To be able to see more planets, you have to use the **SCALE** variable in **_planet.py_**.
- Basic scale is 200 (for sun, earth, mars, mercury, venus).
- Minimum scale for jupiter - 90. 
- Minimum scale for saturn - 50.
- Minimum scale for uranus - 25.
- Minimum scale for neptune - 15.
